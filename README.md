# Memory Game

* Live Demo

## Objective

To build a memory game using React to practice using hooks to manage and utilize states. The memory game involves having the player try to click each card only once and after each click, the cards are shuffled into a different order. The game ends when the player clicks on a card they have already clicked on before. Full details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card).
